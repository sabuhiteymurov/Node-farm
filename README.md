## NodeFarm

This is a simple project for understanding core nodeJS, I have used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for [server-side rendering](https://www.heavy.ai/technical-glossary/server-side-rendering) and JSON for storing, reading data.

### Getting started

First, install the dependencies using:

```
npm i
# or
npm install
```

Then start the node server on port 8000 using nodemon:

```
nodemon index.ts
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The server auto-starts as you edit the file.
